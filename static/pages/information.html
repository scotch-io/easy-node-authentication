<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
<h3>What is a mining pool?</h3>
<p>A mining pool is a way of being able to mine cryptocurrency quicker by multiple miners working together rather than individually.
Normally you would mine cryptocurrency from your own machine and it might take a while before you receive any currency as it might take a while before the calculations required to mine a block are completed. What the mining pool does is distribute the processing power needed to mine each block. This means that blocks can be mined quicker and the appropriate amount of currency is allocated depending on how much work your machine has put in.
</p>
<h3 class="float-right">Why RustyLock pool?</h3><br /><br /><br/>
<p>There are multiple mining pools available (e.g. long list at <a href="https://www.inspiration-for-success.com/electroneum-mining-pools/" target="_blank">https://www.inspiration-for-success.com/electroneum-mining-pools/</a>), 
    each with its pros and cons and the entire variety can be overwhelming. RustyLock pool was created by the group of like-minded people who pulled 
    together their industry knowledge, relevant technical experience and, of course, their view of the future of cryptocurrencies, specifically Electroneum - the new addition to the <a href="https://cryptonote.org/" target="_blank">CryptoNote family</a>, 
    forked from the well-known and established <a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero project</a>.
    Here are the thoughts that lead us to starting our own pool:
    <ul>
        <li>None of us can sit and stare at the hashrate monitor all day so we need a <b>stable pool</b> that can almost "look after itself".</li>
        <li>Electroneum network is very busy with massive total hashrate of around <i>200 Mhash / s</i> that produces a block every minute or two. We need very <b>efficient pool</b> to avoid wasting our hashing power.</li>
        <li>We need reward split mechanism that treats all miners equally regardless of the size and time of their contribution. Everyone on RustyLock pool is rewarded <b>proportionally and fair</b>.</li>
        <li>It's <b>no pool fee</b> now and we can afford to keep it this way for some time.</li>
        <li>We believe in <b>personalized experience</b> and configurable features while most of the pools are very generic and static for each miner.</li>
    </ul>  
</p>
<h3>What about pool fees?</h3>
<p>Running a mining pool isn't cheap, neither it's easy. It needs good hardware, fast networks and substantial amount of time for looking after it.
    Of course, we plan to introduce the pool fee but we will strife to keep it low while focusing more on adding new miners and increasing total pool hashrate to 
            make better returns from the business of running the pool.</p>
<h3 class="float-right">Why registration process?</h3><br /><br /><br/>
<p class="alert alert-warning">We don't collect or store personally identifiable information (PII) and if you register with an <b>email that has no PII</b> associated with it, your experience can be 
    considered completely anonymous. 
</p><p>While we are still working on the personalized features such us hash rate change notifications and aggregated statistics for multiple workers under the same account, 
    features like these will require registration and we want to ensure we have it from the start.</p>
